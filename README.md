# React + Vite ChatBot (Progressive Web App) with Gemini API

This project is a chatbot application built with React and Vite that allows users to interact with the Gemini API, a conversational AI platform powered by Google's language model. It is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means it can be installed on devices and used offline. Users can paste their Gemini API key into the application and start conversing with the chatbot.

## Features

- Minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and ESLint rules
- Integration with the Gemini API for generating chatbot responses
- User-friendly interface for pasting API key and interacting with the chatbot
- Real-time conversation with the chatbot powered by Google's language model
- Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality for offline access and installation
